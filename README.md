# Binary tree project

Welcome to the Binary tree project! This project provides a basic implementation of a binary tree in Java, showcasing various tree operations and functionalities.

## Project overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a binary tree data structure in Java. Key features include:

- **Node management**: Adding nodes to the tree, find node in the tree.
- **Traversal methods**: Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversals of the tree.
- **Node summation**: Calculating the sum of all nodes, leaf nodes, and inner nodes.
- **Node discovery**: Finding and printing the leftmost and rightmost nodes in the tree.

## Features

- **Binary tree operations**: Manipulate nodes, traverse the tree, and perform calculations.
- **Comprehensive unit tests**: Includes unit tests using JUnit to ensure correctness of tree operations.
- **Simple console output**: Results of tree operations are displayed in the console.

## Testing (JUnit)
- JUnit is used to write and run tests for the application, ensuring the correctness of various functionalities.
